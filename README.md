# Title

   Front-end assessment using react.js

## Objective
    
    Building the UI for an E-commerce Listing Page based
    on the provided Figma design. The page should display a list of products, and
    each product should have an option to either view the product or add it to the
    cart. There will be no dedicated product page, so when a user clicks "View
    Product," they should be redirected to a custom Thank You page.
    Additionally, when users click "Add to Cart," a modal should open, as per ui
    design.

### Functionality

#### Must Have

1. Header Section:
Mavyax Tech Private Limited CIN U85499UP2023PTC182763
a. A search bar for searching products.
b. Icons for profile and cart.
2. Product List Section:
a. Display a grid/list of products based on the Figma design.
b. Each product card should include:
i. Product Image
ii. Product Name
iii. Price
iv. "View Product" and "Add to Cart" buttons.
c. Clicking "View Product" should redirect the user to a custom
"Thank You" page. There will be no product details page, so you
are required to design a Thank You page from scratch.

3. Add to Cart Modal:
a. Clicking “Add to Cart” on any product should open a modal that
displays the product’s details and an option to confirm adding the
product to the cart.
b. The modal design is included in the Figma file and should be
closely followed.

4. Pagination:
a. Implement pagination to navigate through multiple product
listings (functional but mock data is acceptable).

5. Thank You Page:
a. Create a simple "Thank You" page to which users are redirected
after clicking "View Product". This page should acknowledge their
action with a simple message (e.g., "Thank you for your interest in
[Product Name]!").

### Guidelines to develop a project

#### Must Have

1. UI/UX Implementation:
a. How closely does the final design align with the provided Figma
file?
2. Code Quality:
a. Are the components modular, cleanly structured, and reusable?
3. Functionality:
a. Does the "View Product" button properly redirect to the "Thank
You" page?
b. Does the "Add to Cart" modal function correctly and display as
expected?
4. Attention to Detail:
a. Overall polish, including hover states, modals, and the user
experience.

#### Nice to Have

a. Break down the app into reusable components such as
ProductCard, Header, Pagination, and AddToCartModal.
b. Make sure each component handles a specific functionality.

### Submission Instructions

#### Must Have

1. Source Code:
a. Submit your project via a GitHub repository, with instructions on
how to run the project in the README file.

2. ReadMe:
a. Include a README that explains the approach you took, any
challenges faced, and how to run the project.
